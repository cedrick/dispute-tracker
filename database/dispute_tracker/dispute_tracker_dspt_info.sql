Somewhere in September 2011, I was contacted by the retention department stating that Singtel is offering me the ‘Astro’ pack promotional package as part of being a loyal MIO TV services. I was interested with the package and as such I signed up for the package on a 12 month basis contract which was agreed that on the first 6 month it will cost me S$9.90 and for the next 6 months I am entitled to enjoy the package for free. The personnel from retention department informed me that the service will be activated within 3 working days and I acknowledged. The personnel from the retention department even counter verify my particulars and my latest residential address. Due to my busy working schedule, I trusted and had assumed that Singtel had activated my package. As reflected on my bill dated on the 29/09/2011 on A/C No: 94487935 that my ‘Astro’ pack service was activated on 17/09/2011. It is a regret to say that I have been waiting for the ‘Astro’ pack service up to date. On 30/09/2011 I had called up the service hotline for assistance to update my concern and was informed by the operator that ‘Astro’ package was activated at my previous residential address. I had sought the operator assistance to rectify the issue and the operator informed me that he will get back to me on the matter on the very same day. I am utterly disappointed to say that no one bothered to update me on my status. On 04/09/2011 I had called up the service hotline again and I had to raise my concern for the second time with the operator and he too informed me that he will look into this matter and he even assured me that he will update on my status before 1930hrs. Both your operators did not get back to me at all. Here are concerns: 1) Did the retention department update my residential address on the system? 2) Why was the ‘Astro’ package activated at my previous residential address but the bill was sent at my current residential address? 3) Does it make any sense that the ‘Astro’ package was activate at a residential unit that does not have any MIO TV services? 4) Does Singtel practice any communication within the department to rectify an issue? 5) Are your operators well trained and are they told to get back and update on a customer’s concerned? 6) How long do SingTel requires to rectify an issue? 7) Does Singtel have the customer interest at heart and does Singtel value their customer even after sale service? 8) Does a customer need to keep constantly update and repeat their concerns to get their problem solved? As loyal customer, I felt that Singtel being a reputable company had failed to deliver an expected service. I felt that the mistake made on charging a service that was not delivered is unacceptable at all. I demand explanations within the next 24 hrs and I shall not hesitate to pursue the matter further should Singtel did not take my case seriously.\r\nCustomer Type:   Consumer, Existing\r\nSalutation:   Mr\r\nName:   Muhammad Shahidin Bin Wahid\r\nNRIC/FIN:   S8419498J\r\nContact Number:   98502467',NULL,'October 17','2011-10-17 21:09:48'),(256,17,'NEW','CRC TELESALES ESCALATION NRIC:S1555643I  /Contact #: 91232685/ DEALER CODE :   D2566','','91232685','','','MERIYATI BTE ARBI ','S1555643I','MIO TV','10/7/2011  10:59:00 AM\r\n\r\nCRC TELESALES ESCALATION       \r\nDealer Code      D2566 \r\nName (Registered Sub)    MDM MERIYATI BTE ARBI , mobile: 91232685      \r\nNRIC     S1555643I     \r\nName (Caller)          \r\nNRIC           \r\nRelationship of Caller to Subscriber           \r\nCustomer’s Complaint      cust has a (standalone) miotv installation on the 11th and now would like to apply for miohome instead.\r\n\r\nCust also claimed she was given free installation and would like the same for her miohome appt.\r\n',NULL,'October 17','2011-10-17 21:38:44'),(257,17,'NEW','CRD046894-01','','82281834','','','Ang Yi Lin','S8918742G','MIO TV','10/11/2011  11:30:00 PM\r\n\r\nCustomer Type:   Consumer, Existing\r\nSalutation:   Ms\r\nName:   Ang Yi Lin\r\nNRIC/FIN:   S8918742G\r\nContact Number:   82281834\r\nNature of Feedback:   Complaints\r\nCommenting On:   Mio TV\r\nService Number:   64593063\r\nYour Comments:   Hi Sir/ Madam i am writing in to complaint regarding the ethics of your telesales department. i receive a call yesterday regarding asking me to upgrade my home mio tv, i have straight forward rejected the offer but the telesales keep spamming my call today.

I am extremely displease to receive the call because of the following reasons: 1) The call was made at around 9pm. Is it Singtel policy to call and disturb their customer at such a late timing at night. I do not think that it is appropriate for you guys to make such calls at such a time. 2) I did not even request/subscribe to the MIO tv service and i do not think that it is Singtel\'s right to simply inform me that your engineers are coming down to my house to install MIO tv without me even requesting for the service 3) I am currently situated overseas in the United States and even though I make it clear to the caller that i am overseas and i do not want the service, he continue to question me on why I do not want the particular service installed, citing that it is free. This is simply wrong as I do not think that i had to explain to your customer service on my preference on whether i want Mio Tv or not. 4)As an Singtel operator, he should know that been overseas, i will incur an overseas charge which is extremely expensive. At the end of the call, the call time total up to be 4+ minutes. After a quick check on the website, i realise that this will cost me approximately 10 SGD (due to the IDD charges) i am extremely displease with this kind of marketing tactic that Singtel had employed and i hope you will do something to correct this and compensate me for the charges i incurred. I hope to hear from you about how my case will be handled and please correspond to me by email.

Each of them promised to revert yet I received none. I do not wish to repeat my issue again. Below is the chronological flow of the different CSO I have related my issue to. 1. 29 Sept. Viknesh(from Tech) called to request for feedback for mio TV installation done on 27 Sep. Told him of the issue. Promised to retrieve recorded phone conversation between me and the Sales Consultant. do an investigation and revert. RESULT: No follow up call. 2. 13 Oct. Called 1688 spoke to AL. Asked for status of my previous enquiry. AL informed me that there was no record of my enquiry. Repeated issue to AL again. AL promised to look into the matter and give me a call by next Tuesday (18 Oct). RESULT: No follow up call 3. 31 Oct called 1688 spoke to BEN. Again Ben informed me that there was no record of my previous enquiry. BEN informed me he will be sending out an urgent email to escalate this matter up. I told him that I need someone in charge to give me a call to inform me that this case is looked into. He agreed to include a note in the email to give me a call within the next hour. RESULT: No follow up call till TODAY. I have already dismantled my singtel modem, set top box, cables and everything ready to return to Singtel. I do not wish to waste my time and breath on 1688 anymore. Upon the Submission of this feedback, please get someone who is capable of taking action to revert via my Mobile given above latest by 6pm TODAY 8th Nov 2011.

This isn\'t the first time I received phone calls like that. Couple of weeks ago, I received calls from this number but a lady spoke to me instead. I\'ve called Singtel (1688) to check if this offer is for real.
