And then for your second - 6th month, you can have the 20 family channels w/c includes news, documentary, entertainment and kids channels at the same price of $5.90 for each month for 6mos... \r\n\r\nVerbal agreement was ok, mentioned preview 56 channels on 1st month and 20 family channels on 2nd-6th month.

However, customer seem forgot about it and believed on what she is claiming and mentioned she doesn’t want to hear anymore rubbish from us. I advised the customer to call 1688 and ask for the recording so she can be assured she was not misled.  Customer mentioned she wants to cancel MIO TV service and I told her about the ETC and again she claimed, she wasn’t informed about it. I suggested her to cancel after 6mos so not to pay the ETC.

The agent discussed the MIO TV service for 6 months contract. He discussed the $4. rebate. The customer mentioned that she has Starhub, the agent said not to worry that both MIO TV service and Starhub can co-exist. The agent mentioned that installation is free for the MIO TV. The agent also discussed the price of the service within the 6 months and the price after 6 months. There were instances where the customer had difficulty understanding the agent and asked if he could speak Chinese. The agent tried to spell the word/s that the customer has difficulty understanding. The agent also asked the customer if she had pen and paper to write the important details down. The agent again mentioned that the installation is free. The agent asked what channels the customer preferred to watch. When the customer said Chinese channels the agent was about to discuss the Chinese offer when the customer said that she is about to leave. The agent said that he is almost done and just wanted to discuss to make it clear to the customer. He tried to discuss the Jingxuan pack (50% off for first 6 months) when the customer wasn’t interested with the promo the agent then went back to offering MIO TV for 6 months contract. The agent also mentioned the channels that the customer can have with the service. On the first month 56 channels including the family channels. The customer again mentioned that she had difficulty understanding what the agent is saying. \r\nThe agent explained that the monthly subscription is $9.90 but with the $4. so the customer would only pay $5.90/month for 6 months. On the 7th month onwards the customer would pay for $9.90 for the service.  \r\n(20:32) Agent: on your first month with the promotion the monthly subscription fee would only be $9.90. Can you please write this down.\r\nCustomer: $9.90\r\nAgent: Remember that we are giving you $4./monthly rebate for 6 months, you minus the $4. on $9.90. How much…\r\nCustomer: $5.90\r\nAgent: exactly, you would only be paying $5.90 every month for the first 6 months.\r\nCustomer: for the first 6 months.\r\nAgent: That’s correct. \r\nCustomer: yeah\r\n\r\nThe agent mentioned the channels that the customer can have on the first month, 56 channels and on the second month onwards 20 family channels.  The agent verified the installation address. Asked if there is an alarm system, the customer asked why the agent was asking this question. The agent replied that the reason he is asking this question is to make sure that the MIO TV that would be installed will not interfere with her alarm system. The agent also asked the distance of phone socket to TV. \r\nThe agent asked the customer to state the name and NRIC for the Verbal Agreement and prior giving the NRIC number, conversation went on pause and wife translating the information to her husband and after that Mrs. Phua stated the NRIC # of the subscriber, which is the husband (PHUA HIM KO- S0109540D). \r\n\r\nThe agent was going through the terms and conditions when the customer said that she has to go. The agent said that he is almost done and continued with the terms and conditions. The agent asked if the customer understood, agree and accept the terms and conditions. The customer gave affirmative response. The agent asked for a mobile number where she could be reached.The agent initially looked for the account holder PHUA HIM KO, the customer that answered the phone asked why the agent was looking for him. The agent then asked if she was Mrs. Phua when the customer said yes the agent proceeded with the conversation.  There were instances in the call where the agent and the customer had difficulty understanding each other. The customer had difficulty with English and would sometimes speak what sounded like Chinese. The agent patiently tried to explain the offers to the customer and even asked her to write things down to make it clear. From the transcription above, on 20:32 of the call the agent was able to mention the price for the MIO TV service for the applicable months. The agent should have tried to ask the secondary contact if she is authorized to subscribe for the MIO TV service. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe were able to call back today and spoke with Ms Eng wife of MR PHUA HIM KO, the account holder, as per the customer she would like to cancel the miotv service because they have starhub already and don’t want to pay extra for the miotv service. \r\n\r\nWe explained that even if they already have starhub they can still use miotv service for only $5.90 per month after the $4 rebate. But still Ms Eng don’t want to pay extra, so we explained also that if she will cancel the service and it’s still under promotion there is a charge of $68 for the use of the modem. But Ms Eng keep on saying she don’t want to pay and didn’t mind what we are trying to explain then she hung up.\r\n\r\nWe tried to call her back for the 2nd time still same reaction and simply hung up the phone.','a .

Rep asked if he is still interested to subscribe for this season of BPL; customer said yes, he is interested. \r\n\r\n- Our Staff offered Ultimate pack ($49.90) with 50% off for the first 3 months ($24.95). Staff explained that it will include BPL and the rest of the sports channel and entertainment channels. - Customer said that he is only interested with BPL; Our Staff said that we have an exclusive offer right now where he can have all the channels of MioTV, which is the Ultimate pack. \r\n\r\n- Our Staff explained the terms and conditions with the customer and verified his name and NRIC as well as the account holder’s name (wife) and NRIC. \r\n\r\n- The customer (husband) agreed to accept the offer on behalf of his wife and gave an affirmative response on the VA. \r\n\r\n- Our Staff was able to explain the offer clearly, including the terms and conditions, to the customer and the customer agreed to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs instructed we called back the customer and spoke to the wife which is the account holder, scenarios as follows;\r\n\r\n-The rep was able to speak with the wife herself , NUR HASIKIN BINTE ANUAR and tried to explain what the offer her husband agreed with us.\r\n\r\n-The wife said that she only wants to stick to whatever her husband has right now which is the $25/monthly for the Twin Pack. Rep trying to convince and explained the price, the contract and all the channels that come along with the Ultimate Pack. \r\n\r\n-The wife firmly told the rep that they will just be continuing what they have currently.  Rep tried to explain politely and was questioned why did he have to speak with the husband when the account is under her name wherein the rep narrated what happened in which he asked for her first but the husband was the one who answered the phone. \r\n\r\n-Rep informed the wife that  should they want to terminate the order earlier, there will be a charge if that is the case. This is the point when the wife started to lose her temper and was really stiff  that they will just keep what they have. \r\n\r\n-Rep did a quick narration to the wife on how he called, was able to speak with the husband, the husband showed interest after all that has been discussed, and asked the husband if he has any questions before closing the deal. And wife stated that she is not giving authorization to her husband and claimed that husband doesn’t understand much in English.\r\n\r\n- The wife (MISS NURHASIKIN BINTE ANUAR) insisted that the rep should\'ve asked for her mobile number  to be able to get to her and that she is not giving any authorization to the rep to do anything.\r\n\r\nWe ended the call with MISS NURHASIKIN BINTE ANUAR (wife) asked for a local Superior that she can talk today and would like to receive a call after 530pm. So this customer just want to switch back to the old pack and not honor what her husband agreed upon. \r\n\r\nAttached is the recording of the sales call just in case you need for reference.

I probed what really the customer is having. Customer said he has exPlore Home Sports 50 which means that Sports channel is part of the monthly charges for exPlore Home Sports 50. Upon listening to the VR when Ultimate package was offered by our staff on Aug 26, it was not stated/established that Sports channels were part of the bundled service. Since we have limited information as to what customer has, staff probed if customer requested for the Sports Channels or was it given to him free, customer said he requested for it.

Agent advised the customer that there would be minor trunking and drilling but it is for free. Agent went ahead to the VA. Customer asked if she would be liable if in any case the engineers cant install the MioTV because is her house is complicated and it is a 3 floor house. Agent said it will be properly installed by the engineers and we’ll make sure that it will not be messy. Customer was hesitant if she will be charge if in any case it can’t be fixed.

Agent offered the customer a wireless connection so the customer doesn’t have to worry about the wirings.

And, on the 2nd call made she never brought up about wireless connection and our staff  asked her  how far is the phone socket from the TV; and she said it is beyond 3 meters, then she was informed by our staff  that we are providing up to 20 meters of trunking for free so that there will be no messy wiring.  \r\n \r\nThe customer said that when the engineers were setting up the connection for the MIO TV. They found out that the TV needed to install or to have a “selector” or an “extra gadget” so that she can use MIO TV. The customer told me that the engineers should have checked first or informed the customer before they ran the wire in her home. The customer found the wiring messy. Now, the engineers removed the wiring and didn’t install the MIO TV, and in the process left marks on the customer’s wall. She then had to call a painter to re-paint the marks left on the walls. The engineers removed the MIO TV connection and left marks on the customer’s wall. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn this event, Since it wasn’t the customer’s fault that she needed another device to make the MIO TV work then she should not be charged the cancellation for the MIO TV. \r\n\r\nCase Closed','RESOLVED','Case Closed',NULL,'2011-10-19 18:16:01'),(678,273,17,NULL,NULL,'NEW',NULL,NULL,NULL),(679,273,17,'Joy Arenas [joy@outsource2northstar.com] \r\n\r\nHi Melvin,\r\n\r\nThis is the same customer we had in one of our disputes last week where the customer wanting to bundle up BBOM with broadband.

When the customer gave affirmative response then the agent proceeded with the offer of the MIO TV. The agent spoke with the account holder’s husband. The agent asked if he was authorized and can decide regarding the home phone account. The customer answered that, “she’s no more”.  The agent was speaking to the account holder’s husband. The agent asked if he was given authority to decide regarding the account. The customer said, “actually what you want I don’t know”. The agent again tried to explain the reason for the call. That their phone line is under SingTel and as a valued customer they are given a promotion for the MIO TV. This has a $4 rebate for the first 6 months. The agent discussed the channels that the customer could get with the promotion. The customer was able to give the installation address, the distance of phone socket to TV.

Any promotion should be coursed through her. The customer said that nobody called before coming over. She said that Mr. Leong is her father-in-law. The customer said that she doesn’t need the promotion because no one is at home.  The customer said that she has informed her husband and they do not want the MIO TV.            \r\n\r\nIn this case, it is difficult for the agent to determine that the person spoken with or husband of the account holder had mental disability. During the call the customer was replying to the agents’ questions. Since the daughter-in-law said that she should be the one to be informed for such promotions for SingTel. All we could do is take note of this information. After finding out from Mrs. Leong that she is the authorized person for the account the promotion was extended to her. But customer said that she already discussed this with her husband and they do not want the MIO TV since no one is at home.','Tue 11/1/2011 7:18 PM\r\nRommel Carrillo [rommel@outsource2northstar.com]\r\n\r\nNicole,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n417\r\n 14-Oct-11\r\n 14-Oct-11\r\n 01-Nov-11\r\n 9am-11am\r\n 67541189\r\n  \r\n  \r\n BLK 150 YISHUN STREET 11 #10-14 SINGAPORE 760150 \r\n NG LEW GICK \r\n S0688799F \r\n MIOTV \r\n - \r\n NEW \r\n  \r\n MioTV with 6 months contract.

When the customer gave affirmative response then the agent proceeded with the offer of the MIO TV. The agent spoke with the account holder’s husband. The agent asked if he was authorized and can decide regarding the home phone account. The customer answered that, “she’s no more”.  The agent was speaking to the account holder’s husband. The agent asked if he was given authority to decide regarding the account. The customer said, “actually what you want I don’t know”. The agent again tried to explain the reason for the call. That their phone line is under SingTel and as a valued customer they are given a promotion for the MIO TV. This has a $4 rebate for the first 6 months. The agent discussed the channels that the customer could get with the promotion. The customer was able to give the installation address, the distance of phone socket to TV. He was also able to give his name and NRIC and the account holder’s name. The agent was able to discuss the terms and conditions but the call got disconnected.\r\n\r\n2nd call:                                                                                                                                                                                       \r\n\r\nThe agent called the customer back and continued with the terms and conditions. The agent informed customer of the installation date and time. The agent asked if the customer understood, accept the terms and conditions. The customer gave affirmative response.\r\n\r\nI was able to spoke with Mrs. Leong, she would like to be called on her mobile instead of the home phone line. Any promotion should be coursed through her. Mrs Leong is claiming that  nobody called before coming over. She said that Mr. Leong is her father-in-law. After finding out from Mrs. Leong that she is the authorized person for the account the promotion was extended to her. But customer said that she already discussed this with her husband and they do not want the MIO TV she doesn’t need the promotion because no one is at home all the time. \r\n\r\nThe contact person for the registered customer has given feedback that the registered customer has passed away for several years already. It seems that the call was taken in by the customer\'s husband, who may be suffering from mental disabilities      In this case, it is difficult for the agent to determine that the person spoken with or husband of the account holder had mental disability. During the call the customer was replying to the agents’ questions. Since the daughter-in-law said that she should be the one to be informed for such promotions for SingTel. All we could do is take note of this information. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCase Closed.','PENDING','',NULL,'2011-11-02 14:02:10'),(830,318,17,'Tue 11/1/2011 6:03 PM\r\nKwong Jie Hui Melvin [melvinkjh@singtel.com]\r\nHI Joy,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAny updates with this?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMelvin Kwong\r\n\r\n****\r\nTue 11/1/2011 6:21 PM\r\nJoy Arenas [joy@outsource2northstar.com]\r\nHi Melvin, \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUpon checking on the call logs for this customer, the last date the customer was called was on 24 Oct and was disposed as DNC upon customer’s request.

We tried offering similar Malay channel (Our Astro Pack) however customer said that his Mom loves to watch Sensasi, and we gave our apology for the confusion made by our new staff. When we speak to him he said that he is planning to go to Hello shop and bring back the  STB, we told him to give us 1 -2 days to escalate his issue and we will call him back.','PENDING','',NULL,'2011-11-11 13:44:43'),(896,350,17,'Thu 11/10/2011 6:00 PM\r\nLinda Ling [lindaling@singtel.com]\r\n\r\nHi Arthur\r\n \r\nyes i would treat this really as a serious mistake made by staff as it\'s 2 major mistake in 1 call and QA did not manage to hear that mistake? \r\n \r\nSo meaning customer will be terminating his miotv then?

As the customer explain, there is a passage or hallway between the his broadband modem and the tv set. Customer is worried on how the connection will be done with this set up. Since the distance bet modem and TV set is more than 3 meters,  we explained to the customer that engineers will be doing minor trunking and drilling. However, customer doesn’t want the wires to be laid on the floor since it will be stepped on the hall way rather, he wants the lay out to be on the ceiling.
