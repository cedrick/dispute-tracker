                  PHP File Renamer

 What is it?
 -----------

 Please backup your files before using this script.

 PHP File Renamer is FREE PHP script that allows you to easily rename many files. I wrote this  script because I once had a problem when I needed to add prefix and lowercase many PHP files. When  you run the script, the script traverses the directory specified and subdirectories(optional)  searching for files and renaming them.

 It's advanced file renamer, for example you can:
 # Uppercase/lowercase your filenames
 # Add prefix, postfix to filenames
 # Replace words in filename
 # Rename all files ending with some prefix (e.g .php)
 # Rename files that have some word in their filename
